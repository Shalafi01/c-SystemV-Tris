# c-SystemV-Tris: Tris game with Shared Memory and Semaphores

## Description

**SystemV-Tris** is a terminal-based implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game (also known as "Tris"), built in C using **System V IPC mechanisms**. It supports two human players competing in real time on Unix/Linux systems. The server manages shared memory, semaphores, and process communication, while the clients handle user interaction and rendering of the game board.

This project demonstrates low-level interprocess communication using:
- Shared memory (`shmget`, `shmat`, etc.)
- Semaphores (`semget`, `semop`, etc.)
- Process creation (`fork`)
- Signal handling (`signal`, `kill`)

The game supports variable-sized square grids (e.g. 3x3, 4x4, ..., NxN), with victory conditions adapting accordingly (N symbols aligned).

## Features

- Multiplayer game using shared memory
- Turn-based logic synchronized with semaphores
- Win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Timeout for moves (optional)
- Graceful termination on `CTRL-C` with IPC cleanup
- Asynchronous communication between server and clients
- Support for custom symbols per player

## How It Works

The system consists of **two executables**:

### ðŸ§  TriServer
Launches the game, initializes IPC, and manages the game loop.

#### Usage:
```bash
./TriServer <timeout> <symbol1> <symbol2>

Example:
./TriServer 10 O X```

timeout: Max time in seconds for each player to make a move (0 = no timeout).
symbol1, symbol2: Custom symbols for each player.

The server:
- Initializes shared memory and semaphores.
- Creates two child processes (clients).
- Alternates turns using semaphores.
- Validates moves and checks for a winner via checkTris() and checkLine().
- Handles SIGINT for graceful shutdown, notifying clients and releasing resources.
